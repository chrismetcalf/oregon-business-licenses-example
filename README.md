State of Oregon New Business Registration Lookup App
====================================================

This is just a simple PHP web app I whipped up as an example during a SODA Consumer API training session. It's a simple web form that takes a search query, runs it against the Data.Oregon.Gov "New Business Registration" data set (http://data.oregon.gov/d/y3km-rmbz), and prints out the results.

The "socrata-php" library is included as a git submodule, so make sure to run "git submodule update --init" once you clone this repository.
